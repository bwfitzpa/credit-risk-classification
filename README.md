## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose of the analysis
The purpose of this anaylsis was to build and train a model to determine if a loan will be risky or not. This was done to help determine which loans should or should not be made in the futre.
### Financial information that the data was on and what needed to be predicted
The data used was on peer-to-peer lending and from a peer-to-peer lending company. The goal was to predict how credit worthy a barrower is. The prediction was made using the features loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt.
### Info about variable that I was trying to predict
The variable that was being predicted is loan status. This variable is a binary variable coded as 0 if the loan is healthy, and 1 if the loan is at a high risk of default. 75036 loans were classified as healthy, while 2500 were classified as high risk.
### Stages of the machine learning process and methods used
Two machine learning models were used, one using logistic regression and another using logistics regression with over sampling of the labels. Oversampling was used in the second model becuase of the inbalance in healthy versus high risk loans. The stages of the machine learning process for each of the models was the same, except for the use of oversampling in the second model. First the lables (loan status) was separtated from the data, and then the features (loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt) were separted and scaled using StandardScaler. StandardScaler was used becuase of the large differnces in some of the scales of the features. The module train_test_split from sklearn was then used to split the data into training and testing data. The logistic model was then instantiated and the model was fit using the training data. From this model predictions were then made and compared to the test data. Each of the models' performance were then examined using an balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report.
## Results of accuracy, precision and recall scores
### Machine learning model using logistic regression
* Accuracy: The logistic regression model overall does a good job of predicting loan status, with an accuracy score of 0.986. Showing this model is correct when predicting if a loan is healthy or high risk 98.6% of the time.
* Precision: That the model performs better when it comes to predicting healthy loans versus high-risk loans is backed up when looking at the classification report. The precision for healthy loans is 1.00, while the precision for high-risk loans is 0.87. The weighted average of these two scores is 1.00. Showing overall the precision of the model is high, but also that precision is much lower when it comes to predicting high risk loans.
* Recall Scores: The recall ratio for the healthy loans are 1.00, and 0.98 for the high risk loans. The weighted average of these two is 0.99. This show for both the healthy loans and the high risk loans the model is doing a fairly decent job at prediciting the loan outcome.
### Machine learning model using logistic regression and oversampling
* Accuracy: The logistic regression model fit with oversampled data does a good job of predicting overall loan status, with an accuracy score of 0.996. Showing this model is correct when predicting if a loan is healthy or high risk 99.6% of the time.
* Precision: That the model performs better when it comes to predicting healthy loans versus high-risk loans is backed up when looking at the classification report. The precision for healthy loans is 1.00, while the precision for high-risk loans is 0.87. The weighted average of these two scores is 1.00. Showing overall the precision of the model is high, but also that precision is much lower when it comes to predicting high risk loans.
* Recall Scores: The recall ratio for the healthy loans are 0.99, and 1.00 for the high risk loans. The weighted average of these two is 0.99. This show for both the healthy loans and the high risk loans the model is doing a fairly decent job at prediciting the loan outcome.

## Summary of the results comparing the two models and recommendation
I would recommend using the second model that used oversampling, but with the caveat that there is room for improvement of this model. That is the model is the best one out of the two and that as more data are added the performance of the model should improve. The underlying issue as to why both models is doing a poorer job of predicting high-risk loans is a result of loan status being unbalanced, the target values are 75,036 healthy loans, but only 2,500 high-risk loans. This said, this is a good problem to have becuase it means that vast majority of loans that have been made are healthy loans and only a few loans are risky. Thus the vetting process to determine who should get a loan is working fairly well. But given that some loans are still risky there is room for improvement.

There are a few reasons for choosing the second model over the first one. First when comparing accuracy scores the second model performs about a percent better than the first one. However the main reason for choosing the second model over the first one is that that second model does a better job at predicting what loans will be high risk. It is more important to be accurate in predicting which loans will be high risk becuase if a borrower defaults on their loan this comes with a large financial hit to the lender. While predicting healthy loans is important, if the model does not preform as well at predicting healthy loans this might lead to less borrowers getting loans but it will not lead to increased risk for the lender.
